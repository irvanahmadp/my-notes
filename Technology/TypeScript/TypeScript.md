# What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a **syntactic superset** of JavaScript that adds **static typing**. It was created by Microsoft.  
A **superset** means that TypeScript extends and enhances the features of JavaScript. We can use all JavaScript features in TypeScript, but we cannot use all TypeScript features in JavaScript.
# Why  should we use TypeScript?
JavaScript is a **dynamic** language, so it is **loosely typed**. This means it can be difficult to understand the **data types** of variables in JavaScript.  
Developers often need to check the documentation to determine the data type of a variable or the expected type of a function parameter.  
TypeScript allows developers to **specify data types**, and it will report an error if there is a type mismatch.
